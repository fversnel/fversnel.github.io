Hi, my name is Frank Versnel and I'm currently working on the game
[Volo Airsport](https://volo-airsport.com) together with Martijn Zandvliet. We make this game with the Unity
engine and during development we run into all sorts of software design issues
with the engine. This blog is about the issues we encounter and the solutions that we came up with. It attempts to teach good software design practices for game programming.
