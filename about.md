Hi, my name is Frank Versnel and I work as freelance software engineer.

You may know me as the game developer behind [Volo Airsport](https://volo-airsport.com) together
with Martijn Zandvliet. We made this game with the Unity engine and during development we run into
all sorts of software design issues with the engine. This blog is about the issues we encounter and
the solutions that we came up with. It attempts to teach good software design practices for game
programming.
